    <p>This cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>
    <p>She is also very furry, and indeed she likes to leave clumps of her fur everywhere to make sure everyone knows it.</p>
    <p>However, there is no cuter feline on the planet! (...And she isn't really <i>that</i> grumpy...)</p>
    <h2>Cat Attributes</h1>
    <p>This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cat</a> will sometimes be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>grumpy</li>
      <li>furry</li>
      <li>smelly</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Yet, she is somehow always cute.</p>
